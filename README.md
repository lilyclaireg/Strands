# Strands
I took CPSC1070 at Clemson University in Spring 2024, where we primarily worked with C and C++. For one project, I replicated the NYT Games' Strands using my Mac's terminal. The game reads a text file input with the grid size, word length, and grid letters, and challenges the player to find hidden words within the grid.
