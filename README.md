# Strands
I took CPSC1070 with Dr. Alex Adkins at Clemson University in Spring 2024, where we primarily worked with C and C++. For one project, I replicated the NYT Games' Strands using my Mac's terminal. The game reads a text file input with the grid size, word length, and grid letters, and challenges the player to find hidden words within the grid. This project will not be reused, hence this code can be published.
